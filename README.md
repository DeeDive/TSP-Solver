# TSP-Solver

**Traveling Salesman Problem** is one of well-known **NP-Complete** problems in the field of computer science. 

In this project, we attempt to solve the problem by using **various classic algorithms** and **Qt 5.12 for visualization**.

#### History ####

In the past few decades, many researchers have endeavored to solve the NPC problems, especially TSP. 

There has been a shifted focus from certain complexity improvement to specific problem instances.

As a consequence, the scale of the problem we can solve is growing exponentially (see Figure 2).
